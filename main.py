I hope you're doing well!

I recently attended the industry networking event at Monash University on July 25th, where I had the chance to learn more about the exciting work happening at {company}. The insights I gained reaffirmed my interest in contributing to innovative, impactful engineering teams like yours.

I’m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience in cloud platforms, infrastructure automation, and backend systems using Java and Python. I’m especially drawn to environments where I can grow technically while contributing to real-world solutions — something I believe your team exemplifies.

Please find my resume attached. I’d be genuinely grateful for a chance to connect or to be considered for any opportunities you think might align.

Kind regards,
